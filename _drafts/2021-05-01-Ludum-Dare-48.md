Its that time of year again. If you have read (a fair number of) my previous posts, you may know that there is a [biannual](https://www.google.com/search?q=biannual) game jam called [Ludum Dare](), which I have [participated in before](). Well, this year I rounded up a handful of by developer friends (@rsninja722, @wm-c, and @catarinaburghi), and we gave it a shot again.

Unlike last year's game, which was written in JavaScript with @rsninja722's [game.js]() library, we wrote this game in [Rust]() using @raysan5's [raylib](). This was a whole bunch of new experiences bundled together for the team. For me, this was my first time working with GPU-based graphics, and for the others, this was their first time working with Rust.
